### 🧪 How the Tests Work

The test suite automates the happy path checkout flow on SauceDemo:

**Login Page**
- Opens the Sauce Labs site
- Logs in with valid credentials

**Inventory Page**
- Selects 3 random unique items to add to cart

**Cart Page**
- Verifies exactly 3 items are in the cart
- Proceeds to checkout

**Checkout Step One**
- Fills in customer information from .env file

**Checkout Step Two**
- Verifies order summary is displayed
- Order Completion
- Finishes the order and verifies the success message
